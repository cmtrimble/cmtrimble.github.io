        <h2>Professional Background</h2>
        <p>Hello, I’m Caleb Trimble, a dedicated and adaptable professional with over 16 years of experience as an active-duty Navy Sailor. Serving as a Cryptologic Technician (Collection), I specialized in analyzing and reporting, leveraging tools like Excel to uncover insights into adversarial movements during multiple deployments.</p>
<p>After my time in the Navy, I transitioned into a data analyst role, where I worked with large datasets to identify trends and ensure the operability of diverse communication systems. Currently, I’m a full-time student, just months away from earning my Bachelor’s in Data Science. I’m eager to embrace new challenges and opportunities in this next chapter of my career.
</p>
