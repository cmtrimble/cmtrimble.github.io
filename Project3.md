    <h2>Key Insights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Industry-level forecasts highlight sectors with strong growth potential, particularly those projected by ARIMA models. High-growth industries such as Social Assistance (73.3%), Data Processing & Internet Services (58.2%), and Ambulatory Health Care (50.8%) present substantial investment opportunities, driven by demographic shifts, technological advancements, and evolving societal needs.</li>
        <li>Beyond percentage growth, industries with large projected GDP values offer stability and strong economic contributions. Real Estate and Rental Leasing ($5.26T), Real Estate ($4.73T), and Educational Services, Health Care & Social Assistance ($3.59T) remain foundational pillars of the U.S. economy. Effective investment strategies should balance high-growth emerging opportunities with established sectors for long-term stability.</li>
