# Predictive Application: U.S. Energy Consumption

---

<div class="project-detail-section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Energy Consumption Prediction Application is a predictive analytics tool that forecasts future energy consumption for various energy sources in the United States.</li>
      <li>Utilizing historical data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the application generates predictions for energy consumption from the last recorded date to a user-selected future date.</li>        
    </ul>
