# Project 1: [Modern Seismology and Geophysics Analysis]

## Details
Hypothesis: Earthquake clusters near tectonic boundaries correlate with higher magnitudes and shallower depths.
Business Relevance:
* Refine risk maps for governments and insurers.
* Improve sensor deployment and data accuracy.

## Key Insights
- [Identify high risk zones that are close to, or directly on top of, active fault lines.]
- [Implement early warning systems to detect P-Waves to alert us before the more powerful S-Waves arrive and cause damage.]
- [Identify currently active tectonic regions that indicate an accumulation of energy that is being released.]
