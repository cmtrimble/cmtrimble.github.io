<div class="project-detail-section">
    ## Overview
    Analyzing tectonic data to improve earthquake prediction accuracy.
</div>

<div class="project-detail-section">
    ## Hypothesis
    Earthquake clusters near tectonic boundaries correlate with higher magnitudes and shallower depths.
</div>

<div class="project-detail-section">
    ## Business Relevance
    - Refine risk maps for governments and insurers.
    - Improve sensor deployment and data accuracy.
</div>
