# Project 1: Modern Seismology and Geophysics Analysis

---

<div class="project-detail-section">
    ## Details
    **Hypothesis:** Earthquake clusters near tectonic boundaries correlate with higher magnitudes and shallower depths.

    **Business Relevance:**
    - Refine risk maps for governments and insurers.
    - Improve sensor deployment and data accuracy.

    ## Key Insights
    - Identify high-risk zones that are close to active fault lines.
    - Implement early warning systems to detect P-Waves before S-Waves arrive.
    - Identify currently active tectonic regions indicating energy accumulation.
